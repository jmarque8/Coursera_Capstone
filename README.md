# IBM Data Science Professional Certificate - Capstone Project
This repository is for storing the Jupyter Notebooks for the Coursera's IBM Data Science Professional Certificate Capstone Project.

We can find the files that the instructors ask to upload including some training such as the Segmenting and Clustering Neighborhoods in Toronto
and the final project.

The final project is a comparative between the two largest cities in Spain, Madrid and Barcelona, using the net income per capita and the venues distribution in the different disticts of each city. The venues selected are all related with infrastructures that lead to a good quality of living.

In the Capstone final project we were asked to upload a report, a presentation and the Jupyter Notebook with the code.

The files related with this final project are:

- Report: A_social_economic_comparative_between_Barcelona_and_Madrid_report.pdf
- Presentation: A_social_economic_comparative_between_Barcelona_and_Madrid_presentation.pdf
- Jupyter Notebook: the_battle_of_the_neighborhoods_week2.ipynb
